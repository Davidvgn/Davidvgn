## Hi there 👋, I'm David !

![Les Stats GitHub de Anurag](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=davidvgn&show_icons=true&theme=radical)

I am currently immersing myself in Android development, honing my skills in Java and Kotlin, while also contributing as an intern with a focus on Flutter app development using Dart in a professional setting. This unique dual role enables me to expand my expertise in both native Android and cross-platform mobile development, making me a more versatile and well-rounded developer.

My journey in Android development has equipped me with proficiency in a diverse set of tools and best practices. I have become proficient in the use of  :

- ☑️ Android fundamentals, such as  :
  - ☑️ Activity and Fragment
  - ☑️ BottomNavigationBar and NavigationDrawer
  - ☑️ Toolbar, CollapsingToolbarLayout and ConstraintLayout
- ☑️ Location-based features with Google Maps API
- ☑️ Hilt for efficient Dependency Injection (DI)
- ☑️ Room for seamless local data management
- ☑️ Implementation of the MVVM pattern combined with LiveData
- ☑️ Creating responsive and data-oriented user interfaces
- ☑️ Retrofit for simplified network requests and API interactions
- ☑️ RecyclerView for dynamic and efficient display of data
  - [Basic RecyclerView In Kotlin](https://github.com/Davidvgn/recyclerView_Kotlin)
- ☑️ Repository Pattern to ensure that my code remains maintainable and scalable
- ☑️ JUnit and Mockito for rigorous testing and validation 
- ☑️ Glide to optimized image handling
- ☑️ Firebase Firestore to enable real-time database functionality

### You may see all of it in my project in Java [Go4lunch](https://github.com/Davidvgn/go4lunch)

Here, you can observe the use of OAuth, the implementation of multilingual 🇬🇧/🇫🇷, and three distinct fragments:
  - Map View: Displays the user's location with surrounding restaurants.
  - List View: Presents a list of all restaurants in the vicinity of the user.
  - Workmates: Displays a list of the user's workmates.

- Once the user is logged in, they can select the restaurant where they plan to eat. Subsequently, in the workmates fragment, all users can see where their colleagues have planned to dine.
- Furthermore, users can click on the menu and navigate to 'Your Lunch' to view the restaurant they have selected for their meal.

Here, users have the ability to engage in real-time chat:

Here, a user can utilize a search bar to find a restaurant, complete with predictive suggestions. In the Map View, the color marker for the matching restaurant undergoes a change, providing visual feedback. In the List View, only the matching restaurant is visible on the list.
