I am currently immersing myself in Android development, honing my skills in Java and Kotlin, while also contributing as an intern with a focus on Flutter app development using Dart in a professional setting. This unique dual role enables me to expand my expertise in both native Android and cross-platform mobile development, making me a more versatile and well-rounded developer.

My journey in Android development has equipped me with proficiency in a diverse set of tools and best practices. I have become proficient in the use of  :

- ☑️ Android fundamentals, such as  :
  - ☑️ Activity and Fragment
  - ☑️ BottomNavigationBar and NavigationDrawer
  - ☑️ Toolbar, CollapsingToolbarLayout and ConstraintLayout
- ☑️ Location-based features with Google Maps API
- ☑️ Hilt for efficient Dependency Injection (DI)
- ☑️ Room for seamless local data management
- ☑️ Implementation of the MVVM pattern combined with LiveData
- ☑️ Creating responsive and data-oriented user interfaces
- ☑️ Retrofit for simplified network requests and API interactions
- ☑️ RecyclerView for dynamic and efficient display of data
- ☑️ Repository Pattern to ensure that my code remains maintainable and scalable
- ☑️ JUnit and Mockito for rigorous testing and validation 
- ☑️ Glide to optimized image handling
- ☑️ Firebase Firestore to enable real-time database functionality
