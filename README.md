### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm David !

![Les Stats GitHub de Anurag](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=davidvgn&show_icons=true&theme=radical)

I am currently immersing myself in Android development, honing my skills in Java and Kotlin, while also contributing as an intern with a focus on Flutter app development using Dart in a professional setting. This unique dual role enables me to expand my expertise in both native Android and cross-platform mobile development, making me a more versatile and well-rounded developer.

My journey in Android development has equipped me with proficiency in a diverse set of tools and best practices. I have become proficient in the use of Hilt for efficient Dependency Injection (DI), Room for seamless local data management, and the implementation of the MVVM pattern combined with LiveData, creating responsive and data-oriented user interfaces. My toolbox also includes Retrofit for simplified network requests and API interactions, as well as RecyclerView for dynamic and efficient display of data.

In addition to these core elements, I have demonstrated expertise in Android fundamentals, such as Activity and Fragment, and harnessed the power of Google Maps for location-based features. I've designed smooth and intuitive navigation experiences through components like BottomNavigationBar and NavigationDrawer, while crafting polished and user-friendly UIs using Toolbar and CollapsingToolbarLayout with the versatile ConstraintLayout. I've optimized image handling with Glide and integrated Firebase Firestore to enable real-time database functionality. Leveraging the Repository Pattern, I ensure that my code remains maintainable and scalable. My commitment to quality shines through my rigorous testing and validation using JUnit and Mockito. These combined skills empower me to create rich and exceptional Android applications, providing users with an outstanding experience.
