### Hi there 👋, I'm David !

![Les Stats GitHub de Anurag](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=davidvgn&show_icons=true&theme=radical)

I am currently learning Android development using Java and Kotlin while working as an intern, specializing in Flutter app development with Dart in a company. This dual role allows me to gain expertise in both native Android and cross-platform mobile development, enhancing my skills and versatility as a developer.

I have gained experience in Android development, having successfully employed a wide array of essential tools and patterns. My expertise includes using Hilt for Dependency Injection (DI) to streamline project structure, integrating Room for efficient local data storage, and implementing the MVVM pattern with LiveData for data-driven, responsive user interfaces. In addition, I have utilized Retrofit for network requests and API interactions.

My proficiency extends to core Android components such as Activity and Fragment, and I have harnessed Google Maps for location-based functionality. I have designed seamless navigation with elements like BottomNavigationBar and NavigationDrawer, while creating polished UIs with Toolbar and CollapsingToolbarLayout through the versatile ConstraintLayout. For optimized image handling, I've effectively employed Glide. My experience extends to the integration of Firebase Firestore for real-time database applications and leveraging the Repository Pattern for maintainable, scalable code. I also ensure code quality through thorough testing and validation using JUnit and Mockito. These skills collectively enable me to create feature-rich Android applications that deliver a superior user experience.
