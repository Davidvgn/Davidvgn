  I am currently learning Android development using Java and Kotlin while working as an intern, specializing in Flutter app development with Dart in a company. This dual role allows me to gain expertise in both native Android and cross-platform mobile development, enhancing my skills and versatility as a developer.

  I have gained experience in Android development, having successfully employed a wide array of essential tools and patterns. My expertise includes using

 for Dependency Injection (DI) to streamline project structure, integrating **Room** for efficient local data storage, and implementing the **MVVM pattern with LiveData** for data-driven, **responsive user interfaces**. In addition, I have utilized **Retrofit** for network requests and API interactions.

  My proficiency extends to core Android components such as **Activity and Fragment**, and I have harnessed **Google Maps** for location-based functionality. I have designed seamless navigation with elements like **BottomNavigationBar and NavigationDrawer**, while creating polished UIs with **Toolbar and CollapsingToolbarLayout** through the versatile **ConstraintLayout**. For optimized image handling, I've effectively employed **Glide**. My experience extends to the integration of **Firebase Firestore** for real-time database applications and leveraging the **Repository Pattern** for maintainable, scalable code. I also ensure code quality through thorough testing and validation using **JUnit** and **Mockito**. These skills collectively enable me to create feature-rich Android applications that deliver a superior user experience.
